## Description

This is a back-end application I made that is a basic back-end for a social media app. There are API routes to add Users and Thoughts. Users can add and remove friends, and add reactions to existing Thoughts.  There are also routes to view all users and thoughts and their associated reactions and friends. There are routes to update and delete Users and Thoughts, and to remove reactions. In the future I hope I can implement functionality to remove associated thoughts when a user is deleted.

## Installation

Fork is you'd like to use as a starter for yourself!

To install dependencies, use this/these command/s: 'npm i' to install dependencies, 'npm run start' to start server, 'npm run dev' to run nodemon

## Usage

Use this to play with a social media back-end or to add a front-end to it!
